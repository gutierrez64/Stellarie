        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Neptune, the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system, is a fascinating ice giant
            shrouded in mystery. In this article, we will embark on a journey to explore the enigmatic world of
            Neptune, including its physical characteristics, its turbulent atmosphere, its ring system, its diverse
            moons, and the missions that have expanded our understanding of this distant blue giant.</p>

    <section id="physical-characteristics">
        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Neptune is known for its brilliant blue color, which is attributed to the presence of methane in its
            atmosphere. It has a diameter of approximately 49,244 kilometers (30,598 miles) and is composed primarily
            of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of methane and other compounds. Neptune's interior is thought to
            contain a layer of icy and rocky materials surrounding a dense, hot core.</p>

    <section id="atmosphere">
        <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
        <p>Neptune's atmosphere is dynamic and stormy, featuring powerful winds and massive storms. The most famous
            feature is the Great Dark Spot, a massive storm system similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The atmosphere
            is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, along with methane, which gives the planet its distinctive blue
            color.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="rings">
        <h2>Rings</h2>
        <p>Neptune has a faint and tenuous ring system, which was discovered in 1984 during a stellar occultation
            observation. The rings are primarily composed of small particles, including dust and ice. Although not as
            prominent as Saturn's rings, Neptune's ring system is an important feature of the planet's environment and
            dynamics.</p>

    <section id="moons">
        <h2>Moons</h2>
        <p>Neptune has a diverse collection of moons, with 14 known satellites. The largest and most famous moon is
            Triton, which is unique among large moons in the solar system due to its retrograde orbit, suggesting it
            may have been captured by Neptune's gravity. Triton is known for its icy surface and geysers of nitrogen
            gas erupting from beneath its surface.</p>

    <section id="exploration">
        <h2>Exploration</h2>
        <p>Neptune has been the subject of several space missions, including NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft, which flew
            by the planet in 1989, providing valuable data and images of Neptune and its moons. While no missions
            have yet landed on Neptune or its moons, ongoing studies and future missions may continue to uncover the
            secrets of this distant ice giant.</p>
