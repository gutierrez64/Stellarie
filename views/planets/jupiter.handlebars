        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is a giant gas giant known for its immense size and
            stunning beauty. In this article, we will explore the wonders of Jupiter, its physical characteristics,
            its turbulent atmosphere, its diverse moons, and the missions that have expanded our understanding of
            this magnificent planet.</p>

    <section id="physical-characteristics">
        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, with a diameter of about 139,822 kilometers (86,881
            miles). It is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium and does not have a solid surface. Instead, it
            has a dense core of rock and metal surrounded by layers of gas that create its immense size.</p>

    <section id="atmosphere">
        <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
        <p>Jupiter's atmosphere is famous for its iconic bands of colorful clouds, including the Great Red Spot, a
            massive storm that has been raging for centuries. The planet's atmosphere is primarily composed of
            hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other gases and compounds. It is a dynamic and turbulent
            environment, with powerful storms and lightning.</p>

    <section id="moons">
        <h2>Moons</h2>
        <p>Jupiter has a remarkable system of moons, with over 80 known satellites. The four largest moons, known as
            the Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto), are some of the most intriguing objects in the
            solar system. They have diverse features, including volcanoes, subsurface oceans, and the potential for
            life-supporting conditions on Europa.</p>

    <section id="exploration">
        <h2>Exploration</h2>
        <p>Jupiter has been the focus of several space missions, including NASA's Juno spacecraft, which arrived at
            Jupiter in 2016 to study its composition, gravity field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere. Earlier
            missions, such as Voyager and Galileo, provided important insights into Jupiter and its moons. Future
            missions aim to continue unraveling the mysteries of this giant planet.</p>
