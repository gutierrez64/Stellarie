        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Venus, often referred to as Earth's "sister planet," is a world of extremes. With its thick, toxic
            atmosphere and scorching surface temperatures, Venus presents a unique set of challenges for exploration
            and understanding. In this article, we will delve into the mysteries of Venus, exploring its geology,
            atmosphere, climate, and the missions that have sought to uncover its secrets.</p>

    <section id="geology">
        <h2>Geology and Surface</h2>
        <p>Venus has a rocky surface marked by vast plains, mountains, and thousands of volcanoes. One of its most
            prominent features is Maxwell Montes, the highest mountain on Venus, and Maat Mons, one of the largest
            volcanoes in the solar system. Venus also exhibits extensive lava plains and a lack of water-based erosion
            features.</p>

    <section id="atmosphere">
        <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
        <p>Venus has an incredibly dense and stifling atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide with clouds of
            sulfuric acid. The thick atmosphere creates a runaway greenhouse effect, trapping heat and raising surface
            temperatures to scorching levels. The surface pressure on Venus is about 92 times that of Earth, similar to
            the pressure found 900 meters (3,000 feet) underwater on Earth.</p>

    <section id="climate">
        <h2>Climate</h2>
        <p>Venus experiences extreme climate conditions, with surface temperatures that can reach up to 467 degrees
            Celsius (872 degrees Fahrenheit). Its surface is hot enough to melt lead. The planet also has no
            significant temperature variations between day and night due to its thick atmosphere, which evenly
            distributes heat.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="exploration">
        <h2>Exploration</h2>
        <p>Exploring Venus has been a challenging endeavor due to its harsh conditions. Numerous missions, including
            NASA's Magellan spacecraft and more recently, the European Space Agency's Venus Express, have provided
            valuable insights into Venus' geology and atmosphere. Future missions aim to further study and potentially
            land on Venus to answer lingering questions about this mysterious neighbor.</p>
