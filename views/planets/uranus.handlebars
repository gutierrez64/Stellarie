        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Uranus, often referred to as the "Ice Giant," is a mysterious and intriguing planet in our solar system.
            In this article, we will embark on a journey to explore the enigmatic world of Uranus, including its
            physical characteristics, its unique atmosphere, its ring system, its diverse moons, and the missions
            that have contributed to our understanding of this distant giant.</p>

    <section id="physical-characteristics">
        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is classified as an ice giant. It is characterized by its
            bluish-green appearance, which is due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere. Uranus has a diameter
            of approximately 51,118 kilometers (31,763 miles) and is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, along
            with water, ammonia, and methane ices.</p>

    <section id="atmosphere">
        <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
        <p>Uranus' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen and helium, similar to Jupiter and Saturn. However, it
            stands out for its high levels of methane, which give the planet its distinctive color. Uranus experiences
            extreme seasons due to its significant axial tilt, which is nearly perpendicular to its orbit around the
            Sun. This unique tilt results in dramatic seasonal variations in sunlight and temperature.</p>

    <section id="rings">
        <h2>Rings</h2>
        <p>Uranus has a system of faint and narrow rings that encircle the planet. These rings are composed of dark
            particles, including dust and ice. While not as prominent as Saturn's rings, Uranus' rings are still
            significant and were discovered in 1977 when the planet passed in front of a distant star, causing a
            temporary dip in brightness.</p>

    <section id="moons">
        <h2>Moons</h2>
        <p>Uranus has a diverse collection of moons, with 27 known satellites. The five largest moons are Miranda,
            Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Miranda, in particular, is known for its complex and varied
            geological features. Uranus' moon system continues to be the subject of study, and new moons may be
            discovered in the future.</p>

    <section id="exploration">
        <h2>Exploration</h2>
        <p>Uranus has not been visited by spacecraft as frequently as some other planets, but it has been the subject
            of study from Earth-based telescopes and planetary missions. Future missions may provide more in-depth
            exploration of Uranus and its fascinating characteristics, offering insights into the mysteries of this
            distant ice giant.</p>
