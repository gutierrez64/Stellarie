        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Mercury, the smallest planet in our solar system, is a fascinating world known for its extreme conditions
            and unique characteristics. In this article, we will delve into the mysteries of Mercury, exploring its
            geography, atmosphere, surface features, and the missions that have uncovered its secrets.</p>

    <section id="geography">
        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, and it has a highly elliptical orbit. Despite its small size, it
            experiences extreme temperature variations, with scorching daytime temperatures reaching up to 430 degrees
            Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit) and frigid nighttime temperatures dropping to -180 degrees Celsius (-290
            degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

    <section id="atmosphere">
        <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
        <p>Mercury's atmosphere is incredibly thin and composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, and hydrogen. Due to its
            weak gravity, the planet is unable to retain a substantial atmosphere, allowing solar winds to strip away
            gases over time. As a result, Mercury has a virtually airless and desolate surface.</p>

    <section id="surface">
        <h2>Surface Features</h2>
        <p>The planet's surface is marked by vast plains, deep craters, and towering cliffs. Mercury's most prominent
            surface feature is the Caloris Basin, a massive impact crater that spans over 1,500 kilometers in
            diameter. The planet also exhibits extensive scarps, known as "lobate scarps," caused by the planet's
            cooling and shrinking over billions of years.</p>

    <section id="exploration">
        <h2>Exploration</h2>
        <p>Mercury has been the subject of several space missions aimed at studying its surface and environment. NASA's
            MESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) spacecraft, which orbited Mercury
            from 2011 to 2015, provided valuable data about the planet's geology, magnetic field, and tenuous
            atmosphere. Future missions may further unlock the secrets of this enigmatic world.</p>
