        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Saturn, often referred to as the "Ringed Planet," is one of the most iconic and captivating celestial
            objects in our solar system. In this article, we will embark on a journey to explore the wonders of
            Saturn, its physical characteristics, its spectacular rings, its dynamic atmosphere, its intriguing moons,
            and the missions that have deepened our understanding of this celestial jewel.</p>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is characterized by its stunning system of rings. It is a gas
            giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with a relatively small, solid core at its center. Saturn
            has a diameter of approximately 120,536 kilometers (74,898 miles) and is known for its striking yellowish
            appearance.</p>

    <section id="rings">
        <h2>Rings</h2>
        <p>Saturn's rings are its most distinctive feature, consisting of billions of tiny particles of ice and rock.
            These rings are divided into several distinct bands, including the iconic A, B, and C rings. The rings
            are believed to be the remnants of a moon or a comet that broke apart, forming a stunning and intricate
            system that has fascinated astronomers for centuries.</p>

    <section id="atmosphere">
        <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
        <p>Saturn's atmosphere is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, similar to Jupiter. It features a complex
            system of cloud bands and storms. One of Saturn's notable features is its hexagonal-shaped storm at the
            north pole, known as the "hexagon." This unique pattern remains a subject of scientific study and
            fascination.</p>

    <section id="moons">
        <h2>Moons</h2>
        <p>Saturn is orbited by a vast collection of moons, with over 80 known satellites. Its largest moon, Titan, is
            unique in that it has a thick atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane and ethane on its surface. Enceladus
            is another intriguing moon, known for its geysers of water vapor erupting from beneath its icy crust.
            Saturn's moon system offers a wealth of scientific exploration opportunities.</p>

    <section id="exploration">
        <h2>Exploration</h2>
        <p>Saturn has been the focus of several space missions, including NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which orbited
            Saturn for over 13 years, studying the planet, its rings, and its moons. Cassini's observations provided
            valuable data and insights into Saturn's complex system. Future missions may continue to unravel the
            mysteries of this beautiful and enigmatic planet.</p>
